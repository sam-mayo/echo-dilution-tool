To Do List:

/	Write the logic for calculating dilution volumes and additional source plates
/	Sit down with Corrie and figure out how she goes from parameters and plate map to CSV file. This will determine the business logic of the webtool.
-	Define list of desired webtool characteristics and abilities. This does NOT mean to tackle them all at once, but to ensure that the feature list informs software development.
