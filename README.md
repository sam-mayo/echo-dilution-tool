# echo-dilution-tool
Compound dilutions entirely within an Echo acoustic liquid handler.

The eventual goal of this tool is to allow users to create assay ready plate (ARP) dilutions using an Echo acoustic liquid dispenser without diluting compounds with another liquid handler, such as a Hamilton or Bravo.
