2-fold dilution
10 dilution points
target volume is 100nL
stock concentration is 10mM to start

// create target concentrations
for each dilution point
	divide stock concentration by 2^dilution point index

// create dispense volume list
for each dilution point
	divide target volume by adjusted stock concentration over initial stock concentration
	divide target volume by 2^dilution point index to yield dispense volume
	if dispense volume is not divisible by 2.5
		divide adjusted stock concentration by 10 and try dividing again
	else if dispense volume is divisible by 2.5
		add dispense volume to running list of dispense volumes

find closest number divisible by 2.5 if dispense volume is greater than 100


// new way of doing things
multiply target dispense volume by 10 until divisible by 2.5
if the result is greater than or equal to 100, divide by 10
take result and find closest number divisible by 2.5
result is new dispense volume
